# Design Management

### Overview
At Trifacta I managed and led the design team for 3 years, responsible for all of product design and research.  In that time we grew from a team of 2 to a team of 6.  I was responsible for planning, allocation, delivery, performance, hiring, and design quality.  I worked with my team and executives to improve our processes and create a user centered culture.

### Hiring

Hiring was one of the biggest challenges of managing the team, but also one of the most rewarding.  Big data is an domain that is traditionally void of good design, but the team I built was comprised of a group of talented principal and senior designers that was able to make huge difference to our product. Hiring was one of my biggest accomplishments at Trifacta.

I created and managed the hiring process from start to finish, including sourcing, creating the interview process, interview templates, prioritized criteria, job descriptions, and ultimately onboarding.

### Cross Team Collaboration

At Trifacta we had a weekly cross team release planning meeting that I attended to represent Design.  The planning meeting included the VP of Product, VP of Engineering, Engineering Directors, all of the PMs, and Docs.  Topics discussed included: priorities, feature scope, capacity planning, and release schedules.  I was responsible for the design component of each of the topics.

I also attended weekly Sales meetings with Customer Success and Sales Engineering where we covered customer issues and customer visits.  Attending these meetings gave me first hand insight into current customer pain points and helped create a healthy collaboration between Design and the Field organization.

### Team Growth

Upon hiring new employees, within the first month I like to have an 1 on 1 dedicated to growth and development.  This sets the tone for our relationship and for the employee’s relationship with the company in general.  Understanding their goals gives me the knowledge I need to make my their experience the best it can be.  At least once a month during 1 on 1s I check in on progress and reassess, formally updating the doc every quarter.

The primary tool to structure the conversations was our leveling and growth matrix, which is much more than a promotion ladder.  It’s a tool to communicate the range of design skills and abilities, helping both me and my team member discuss where they are and where they’d like to be.

In addition to growth and development, I looked for opportunities to pair more junior designers with our principal designer or connect them with outside resources, such as our design advisor, to level up their skills.

### Design Process

I’m passionate about creating a healthy, clear, collaborative design process. I believe an explicit and intentional design process can be the foundation of a well functioning team of designers, PMs, and engineers. Design is of course inherently messy and non-linear. A design process shouldn’t be dogmatic, but rather should act as a guide for designers, ultimately removing ambiguity and charting a clear path rather than boxing designers in. **I believe just enough process is a real thing.**

A few of the areas of impact I had on Trifacta’s process:
- I worked with the VP of Product and VP of Engineering to implement a Discovery phase, crucial for design to have the time necessary to better understand the problems and explore potential solutions and crucial for our research to have an impact.
- Established weekly design reviews and planning meetings, allowing for consistent communication and clear goal setting.

### Research

After pairing with Sales to get Design in front of the customer, it became clear we needed a dedicated researcher to level up our research practice.

The VP of Product and CEO were hesitant about the value a researcher would bring to the team.  We decided to bring in a consulting researcher for the organization to test and understand the value of research.  I sourced a well-regarded researcher who worked with the Product and Design team on a foundational research project to better understand our users skills and needs.

Ultimately the project shed light on important details, such as the range of technical ability across our users, which impacted how we thought about creating core parts of the product and how marketing thought about messaging our product.  The project was considered a success, which led to my hiring of our first full time user researcher.
