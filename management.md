# Design Management

### Overview
At Trifacta I managed and led the team for 3 years.  In that time we grew from a team of 2 to a team of 6.  I sourced a

• Defined research process and advocated the value of research in the organization. Worked with Product, Customer Success, and Sales Engineering leadership to get customers involved in the product development process. Hired Trifacta's first researcher.

### Hiring

At Trifacta I grew the team from 2 designs to 5 designers and 1 researcher.  Hiring was one of the biggest challenges of managing the team, but also one of the most rewarding.  Big data is an domain that is traditionally void of good design, but the team I built was comprised of a diverse group of talented principal and senior designers that made a huge difference. Hiring was one of my biggest accomplishments.

To hire, I created and managed the process from start to finish, including sourcing, creating interview process, interview templates, prioritized criteria, job descriptions, and ultimately onboarding.

### Cross Team Collaboration

At Trifacta we had a weekly cross team release planning meeting that I attended to represent Design.  The planning meeting included the VP of Product, VP of Engineering, Engineering Directors, all of the PMs, and Docs.  Topics discussed included: priorities, feature scope, capacity planning, and release schedules.  I was responsible for the design component of each of the topics.

I also attended weekly Sales meetings with Customer Success and Sales Engineering where we covered customer issues and customer visits.  Attending these meetings gave me first hand insight into current customer pain points and helped create a healthy collaboration between Design and the Field organization.

### Team Growth

Upon hiring new employees, within the first month I like to have an 1 on 1 dedicated to growth and development.  This sets the tone for our relationship and for the employee’s relationship with the company in general.  Understanding their goals gives me the knowledge I need to make my their experience the best it can be.  At least once a month during 1 on 1s I check in on progress and reassess, formally updating the doc every quarter.

The primary tool to structure the conversations was our leveling matrix, which is much more than a promotion ladder.  It’s a tool to communicate a range skills and abilities, helping both me and my team member discuss where they are, and where they’d like to be.

In addition to growth and development, I would actively seek opportunities to pair more junior designers with our principal designer or connect them with outside resources, such as our design advisor, to level up their skills.

### Design Process

I’m passionate about creating a healthy, clear, collaborative design process. I believe an explicit and intentional design process can be the foundation of a well functioning team of designers, PMs, and engineers. Design is of course inherently messy and non-linear. A design process shouldn’t be dogmatic, but rather should act as a guide for designers, ultimately removing ambiguity and charting a clear path rather than boxing designers in. **I believe just enough process is a real thing.**

A few of the areas of impact I had on Trifacta’s process:
- I worked with the VP of Product and VP of Engineering to implement a Discovery phase, crucial for design to have the time necessary to better understand the problems and explore potential solutions and crucial for our research to have an impact.
- Established weekly design reviews and planning meetings, allowing for consistent communication and clear goal setting.

### User Centered Culture

Creating a user centered culture at enterprise software companies is a real challenge.  Most customer touch points are with Sales, Sales Engineering, and Customer Success.  Design is often not integrated into these customer conversations, creating a gap in our understanding of our users and an over reliance on Sales to be the voice of the customer.

I worked with Product, Customer Success, and Sales Engineering leadership to get design integrated into initial customer touch points such as POCs and expert sessions.  I began attending the weekly Sales meeting and along with the VP of Product created a shared spreadsheet of all customer sessions with a slot for designers to attend, creating visibility across teams.  Each designer and PM started traveling with Customer Success to customer sessions roughly once a month to conduct various types of research.  This allowed us to get our users more involved in the product development process and exposed a need for a more formal research practice.


### Research

After pairing with Sales to get Design in front of the customer, it became clear we needed a dedicated researcher to level up our research practice.

The VP of Product and CEO were hesitant about the value a researcher would bring to the team.  We decided to bring in a consulting researcher for the organization to test and understand the value of research.  I sourced a well-regarded researcher who worked with the Product and Design team on a foundational research project to better understand our users skills and needs.

Ultimately the project shed light on important details, such as the range of technical ability across our users, which impacted how we thought about creating core parts of the product and how marketing thought about messaging our product.  The project was considered a success, which led to my hiring of our first full time user researcher.
