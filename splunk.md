# Splunk

Splunk is the leading machine-generated data analysis platform.  It’s currently used by 15,000 companies and is worth $14B dollars.

I was part of a small team responsible for the complete redesign of the core Enterprise Splunk product, which generated a majority of the company’s revenue.

The redesign included a completely new design system and front end, major updates to core concepts and pages, and the addition of new features.

In addition to contributions to the design system, I was responsible for Reports, Dashboards, and Alerts.

The design system stood the test of time.  After 6 years it’s still being used, largely unchanged across all of Splunk’s products.
