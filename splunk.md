# Splunk

Splunk is the leading machine-generated data analysis platform.  It’s currently used by 15,000 companies and is worth $14B dollars.

I was part of a small team responsible for redesigning the Splunk Enterprise 5.0, Splunk's core product.

The redesign included a completely new design system and front end, major updates to core concepts and pages, and the addition of new features.

In addition to contributions to the design system, I was responsible for redesigning and enhancing Reports, Dashboards, and Alerts.

The design system stood the test of time.  After 6 years it’s still being used across all of Splunk’s products.

I'd be happy to share more in person.  Reach out if you're interested.
